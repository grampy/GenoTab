#Introduction

**GenoTab** is a fledging project that I have been working on on and off for some while. For many years I have been writing 'Report Generator' scripts under the username **_genome_** for [GenoPro](http://www.genopro.com) of which I am a strong supporter but frustrated at the lack of development.

The long term aim of this project is to provide an open source multi-platform tool for displaying and editing genograms based on GenoPro/GenoProX data files.  I have experimented with a number of javascript libraries for more than a year including **JointJS**, an excellent graphics library for generating SVG diagrams which utilises **jQuery, Backbone,js and Underscore.js** libraries. I am also using **jQuery Mobile** for touch based widgets.

For the time being I have abandoned attempts at editing the data and concentrating on the display aspect. I have found **JointJS** to be unsuitable and now use the **jsRender** templating library to generate the **jQuery Mobile** pages including the SVG GenoMap diagrams.

#How it works and demos

See [Introducing GenoTab](http://support.genopro.com/FindPost38808.aspx) for details and **demos**

Any help with this project would be much appreciated.  My programming skills are weak, rooted way back in the 70s with COBOL and assembler. I struggle to get to grips with new fangled techniques, so development is a slow iterative process to discover what works and what doesn't.
